## <u>About</u>

This site was created as a final project for the Code institute 16 week full stack developer course. The full code can be found on GitHub here: https://github.com/CharlB96/CapstoneProject-Obscuripedia

Obscuripedia is intended to document and display information regarding obscure and often overlooked creatures from across the planet. The site is constructed to have any visitor be able to sign up, log in, and log out with ease. The articles are displayed once you are logged in and the search bar can be used to filter the articles. Although the edit-article and add-article buttons appear certain pages, only those designated as staff can add and edit, plus only the staff who created the articles can edit them as well as delete. 
There is also a section for suggestions, which can be made by any user that is logged in. The articles page shows eight articles per page and is paginated so that articles can be continuously added to the site.  


## <u>Original design idea</u>

Originally I was going to use an idea I had discussed with a friend of mine for their personal site, which i already had a basis for. It was going to be a learning resource for school students, but due to the scale of the site and large amount of javascript functionality required, I was advised to go a different direction. 
Here is the original flow chart i created for that initial idea.

### <u>UX design</u>

When starting this project, I considered a few things before starting. Originally, the project was going to be vastly different, but after discussion with my mentor, I landed on an idea which was more reasonable in scope, thus Obscuripedia was born. 
I wanted to include:
- Easy navigation
- A suggestion page
- A page for aticles
- Register/login functionality
- Ability for staff/admin to add, edit, and delete their own articles
- A navbar for navigation
- A search bar for even easier navigation
- Possibly a newsletter for extra information

### <u>User stories</u>

The user stories were converted into issues with acceptance criteria which were then laid out into a projects board. This is the first time I have experienced an agile development as a single developer, my kanban board can be viewed here: https://github.com/users/CharlB96/projects/4/views/1

- User Story 1: As an animal enthusiast, I want to see obscure animals laid out in an easily readable way so that I can learn new information about creatures i have not heard of before without having to scour a huge article.

- User Story 2: As an animal enthusiast, I want to see details about each animal's taxonomy and location so that I can learn information that is more than just surface level

- User Story 3: As a zoologist, I want to suggest obscure animals that may not be on the website so that I can share my knowledge of obscure fauna with others

- User Story 4: As a casual website visitor (with a mild interest in animals), I want be able to see images of animals so that I can decide, by sight, which animals to view more details on

- User story 5: As a someone who doesn't know much about animals, I want to access some kind of exta infor so that learn more about the site in general

- User Story 6: As an animal enthusiast, I want have special admin access so that edit mistakes or add information to existing pages

- User story 7: As a user, I want to be able to save my favorite obscure animals or create a personal collection for future reference.

- User story 8: As a user, I want the website to be accessible and responsive on various devices, so I can explore obscure animals on my desktop, tablet, or mobile phone.

### <u>Frameworks, Libraries & Progams Used</u>

  - [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com): Basis for project
  - [Cloudinary](https://www.cloudinary.com): Free image store
  - [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/): Host for site
  - [Bootstrap 5.1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/): Used for responsiveness and css classes

### <u>Major Bugs</u>

Dealt with various issues during develpoment including:
- App non functioning; forgot to place new app into installed apps section of settings.py
- Issue loading page; forgot to migrate after changing model
- Difficulty getting responsiveness; had to experiment with bootstrap classes until it was right
- Images not uploading when using form; added request.FILES to view
- Internal server error when deploying to heroku; commented out the STATIC_FILE_STORAGE in settings.py

- Information: All information sourced from wikipedia, in the actual site, the information would be from multiple sources and written transformatively


### <u>Testing and validation</u>

Validation:
- CSS validation, the large amount of warnings are all due to bootstrap classes and --webkit issues.
        ![Image showing no issues with css validation](Images/image.png)


- HTML validation:
#### Home page validation

        ![Home page validation](image.png)

Testing:
 - Testing of the views was done consistently throughout. When signed out, only the home, login, register, and inactive newsletter pages are visible. When logged in, the home, suggestion, 'lets see them animals', log out and inactive newsletter pages are active.
 - When accessing the articles page, the add article button is visible whether logged in or not, however, if you try to press the button and are not logged in, an error will appear saiyng you need to be at least an admin to add an aarticle and you will be taken back to the articles page.
- When logged in (as staff) the add article button takes you to a form with all the relevant fields to fill in, the same goes for the edit button on the article_details page. 
- Also, as astaff, the delete article button is visible on the article detail pages, so long as it is a page you created, you can delete it. 
 - The suggestion page has a simple input section to name an animal and the reason for wanting it on the website. When a suggestion is entered, the form empties and a success message appears at the top of the page, a warning message appears when any issues occur. The suggestion is then viewable through the admin page and can be read by the superuser to then implement the new article if they choose to
         
- The model tests were done manually through the terminal using python3 manage.py shell, the transcript was then placed in this doc:

### <u>Extra</u>

Acknowledgements:
- ChatGPT was used throughout to identify issues in the code (Spelling mistakes, Structrual issues, etc) (https://chat.openai.com/)
- Wikipedia was used for animal information in the articles, along with many of the images (https://www.wikipedia.org/)

Future plans:
- The site could definitely use some expanding in the number of articles made, as well as the amount of information on each animal. Due to time constraints, I created a few articles with limited information, the majority of which was sourced directly from wikipedia. I would want to create fully unique articles per animal and structure the pages with rich text fields to add a bit more style.
- I would want to fully construct the newsletter page and the newsletter itself, possibly to open onto a new page.
- I would want to create a profile page where you can save articles of your favourtite animals and personalise the page somewhat.
